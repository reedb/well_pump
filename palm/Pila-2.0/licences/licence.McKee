Sorry.  A well-timed reminder.  

Please consider 68kasm (my original version for the 68000) public domain.

Mr. McKee, I hate to pester you, but you are the last of six programmers
whose brief statements of permission will fix the Pila project's
defective license.  If you have a minute to spare, a one-line response
would meet that need.  E.g. "Please consider 68kasm public domain" or
"Please consider 68kasm BSD-licensed."

Thank you for your time.

Hello, Mr. McKee.  Thanks for returning my note.

Some programmers working on PalmOS (the operating system of PalmPilots
and compatibles) found your 68kasm code useful as the basis of a PalmOS
assembler, which they named Pila, which has become quite successful and
ubiquitous.  (PalmOS runs on Motorola Dragonball processors, which are
apparently cousins of the 68k series.)  Pila is currently maintained by
Mikael Klasson, at http://mklasson.cjb.net/pilot.html .

Recently, I and others have been helping PalmOS developers deal with
licensing issues.  This involved contacting the credited authors and 
documenting what license terms they wished to specify for their work, 
so that the composite work's overall license status could be determined.
Those authors have elected to declare that their contributions should be
considered public domain.

I should stress that this is _not_ an ideological quest:  Neither I nor
anyone else is lobbying for any particular license terms.  It's just 
that, technically, a work with no license statement occupies an uneasy
legal position, and is believed to be technically illegal to
redistribute.  (In the unlikely event you're interested in details, I 
can provide references.)

Since Pila is, in copyright-law language, a derivative work of your
68kasm codebase, its license status hinges on 68kasm's.  And 68kasm
emerged in the days when people were casual about such things, and thus
has a copyright notice but no explicit license.

Therefore:  What I was thus hoping was that you wouldn't mind stating by
reply e-mail what license terms you (as copyright holder) intend for the
68kasm codebase.  You could, for example, state "I am hereby placing
68kasm in the public domain."  But it's entirely up to you, of course.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance.  (I will also have to 
thank Dr. Miller!)

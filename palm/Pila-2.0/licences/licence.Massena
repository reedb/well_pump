Darrin:

Just a reminder:  You have some source code modules in the Pila
assembler, a work whose licence status I'm trying to help Mikael=20
Klasson (the current maintainer) straighten out.  But we don't yet
have your licence terms for your work.

I've gotten statements from Mikael Klasson, Damien Neil, Wes Cherry,
and Michael Dreher that they wish their contributions to be in the
public domain.  All of those authors' statements have been added to
the source-code archive.  Also, I've just now succeeded in reaching Paul
McKee, author of 68kasm, on which Pila is based.

That leaves you.  Would you mind stating your licence terms for your
work?  A simple "I hereby place my work on Pila in the public domain"
would be one such statement.  You can do so by just replying to this
mail.

Thanks for your help.

# bash script to encode PILA Version 2.0 SDK
# using Palm OS SDK 5.0.1 and Sony SDK 5.0 Version 1.2
# for easy distribution without copyright hassles.
#
# This script assumes that the Palm OS SDK (palmos-sdk-5.0.1.tar.gz)
# and optionally the Sony SDK (cliesdk50e.zip) are in the same directory
# as this script and that the directory ../inc holds the current Pila SDK.
#
# It creates the files pila-palm-sdk-5.zip and pila-sony-sdk-5.zip for
# distribution with the rest of the Pila package.

Pila is a 68000 assembler that runs under Windows 95/NT and Linux and
produces Palm OS executables. Documentation for Pila is in the HTML file
pila-user-manual.html which you should definitely read - even if you know
Pila from previous versions!!!

You can get the Pila distribution archive Pila-2.0.zip from
http://www.schaeckermann.net/pila.html.

Once you downloaded it to your harddrive use any unzip command (i.e. infozip's
unzip - availabe for Linux and Windows) to install the contents of the archive
into any directory of your liking (i.e. ~/PalmDev). This will create a sub-
directory Pila-2.0 containing the documentation, sample code, the binary
executable pila20 as well as all the source code for you to compile your own
binary. Read the documentation in pila-user-manual.html for details about all
the files in the package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used Pila Version 2.0 to create a fairly good-sized project (10KB
of assembled code) and I am pretty sure that it is stable enough and produces 
valid PRCs. Nevertheless I haven't tested it much with intentionally wrong
source code (only unintentionally wrong source which offen enough made Pila
crash - but those problems are fixed *wink*). Therefore there might still
be incidents of Pila hick-uping on some wrong source. If you encounter any
such problem send me the offending source code and whatever else I'll need
to feed it through Pila and I will make sure you'll get a corrected Pila
as fast as I can manage.

Also if you have any suggestions on how to improve anything in the Pila
package (the program, documentation, this readme, etc) please drop me a
line at frmipg602@sneakemail.com.

You will definitely want to get the PilRC tool from Aaron Ardiri's site
http://www.ardiri.com/index.php?redir=palm&cat=pilrc to compile *.rpc files
into PalmOS resources. That tool is not part of this package.

SPECIAL NOTES

- I have been using the CYGWIN tools to compile and run Pila on my Windows 2000
  machine. Which means I was effectively compiling and running a Unix program.
  Naively trying to compile Pila with -Uunix to create a windows executable
  did not work due to missing external references like htonl etc. I didn't spend
  much time on it and I am sure anybody wanting to create a windows executable
  will figure that out fairly quickly.
  It should still be possible to compile Pila for Windows within the right
  environment since I didn't change anything on the "#if unix" constructs
  found in the original source. If there ARE some changes necessary to allow
  compiling a native Windows executable and you have done them, PLEASE send
  me the changes for me to include them in the package!

- Pila sometimes reports the compressed size of an application's data 
  section as being larger than the uncompressed size! This is due to the
  overhead the PalmOS' compression format introduces. When the total size 
  of your data adds up to more than 50 bytes or so, the compressed size 
  should normally be smaller.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinks to do to make Pila even better (in no particular order):

- overhaul of the symbol code to generalize the concept of symbol context
  (see source/symbol.c for details of my ideas here)
- add the possiblity to split a source line over multiple lines via 
  line-continuation (\). It is not as easy as it sounds since I don't want
  to loose the synchonization of written bytes and listed source lines in the
  listing output produced with the option -l.
- look at the FIXME: notes in the user's manual for some smaller tid bits
- make Pila read - and understand *wink* - the original C header files
- macro and function support (call, proc etc are macros already - more or less)
- add ARM assembly to be able to create PNOlets as well
  (I am really looking forward to this one)
- add multi-segment support
- create symbol map for source debugging support
- provide functionality to include compiled static libraries into the PRC
  built by Pila absorbing the symbol definitions from the library at the
  same time. The incbin directive can only read binary chunks byte by byte
  as they appear in the file. (this is a pretty important one)

REVISION HISTORY

ALPHA 1 (7 Aug 1996)
- First release!

BETA 1 (10 Sep 1996)
- added Wes Cherry's PilRC (0.71), a tool for creating Pilot resources,
  to the Pila package
- added Bill Hunt's PilDis (Alpha 1), a tool for disassembling Pilot
  code resources
- added Sample.rcp file to demonstrate resource creation. Sample.rcp
  replaces mbar1.bin and tfrm1.bin which are removed
- added Sample.bat file to build Sample.prc
- added special equates to Pilot.inc for the serial library APIs
- implemented source file name printing in error messages
- implemented a statistics dump after successful assembly. Displays
  sizes for code, data, resource, and the entire PRC. Keep those PRCs
  small!
- implemented a very minor Startup.inc optimization
- fixed bug that was causing line numbers to be offset by one inside
  include files and off by another one in the 'including' file
- fixed a HUGE bug that caused the data section and A5 register to be
  improperly initialized
- updated Sample.asm to demonstrate data section access (amongst other
  things)
- updated PilaUM.htm to incorporate various suggestions I received
  from Alpha testers, including a new section on the PalmOS API
  calling convention and a pointer to an online version of the
  Motorola 680x0 Programmer's Reference Manual -- get it!

Beta 2 (2 Oct 1996)
- added 'align' directive for aligning code/data on user-defined boundaries
- added 'list' directive for enabling/disabling listing output
- added include path support via PILAINC environment variable
- added Copilot-compatible code symbol generation. Specify "-s" and your
  app's code symbols will be available while debugging under Copilot
- updated Startup.inc to use Wes' new directives (see below)
- updated documentation
- changed all errors to be output to stdout, rather than a mix of stdout/
  stderr
- added Wes Cherry's PilRCUI, a tool for previewing Pilot form resources,
  to the Pila package
- updated to Wes Cherry's PilRC version .8

Wes Cherry has been extending Pila and has added many new features to make
assembly language programming easier and less bug-prone. His new directives
and syntax support procedure parameter definition, procedure calling, trap
calling, local and global variable definition, and structure definition and
usage. Wow!

- the new directives are: call, systrap, syslibtrap, local, global, proc,
  beginproc, endproc, struct, endstruct, and sizeof
- added documentation for new directives to PilaUM.htm! Updated examples,
  etc to show new syntax
- Pila names (e.g., labels, equates) are now case sensitive. Instructions
  and directives remain case insensitive
- updated Pilot.inc to use the new structure syntax. Several incorrect
  structure member offsets were fixed in the process
- updated Sample.asm to use the new directives
- fixed the 'end' directive to work as it should and be optional

Beta 3 (2 Nov 1996)
- incorporated Pila into the ASDK package. No more separate Pila releases
- added '-t' command line switch to set PRC type
- fixed problems in Pilot.inc where fields containing small enumerations 
  were incorrectly sized as words instead of bytes
- added an 'align 2' directive to be emitted after each debug symbol
  ('-s' switch)
- fixed DATA 0 resource format to be compatible with future PalmOS upgrades
- fixed other small bugs

Beta 3 Fluff 4 (23 Jan 1998)
This is not an "official" release. I, Mikael Klasson (fluff@geocities.com),
have made the following extensions and so you should blame me for any bugs 
and stuff like that concerning them. They're not Darrin's fault ;)
- labels are local to the procedure if they start with a dot, e.g ".loop"
- a new directive, "incbin", allows you to include binary files straight 
  into your prc file
- implemented compression of the datasection
- fixed a bug with "ds.T X". Even if X was more than 1, only the first
  sizeof(T) bytes were initialized to zero

Beta 3 Fluff 5 (02 Feb 1998)
Linux fixes by Michael Dreher (michael@odo.boeblingen.netsurf.de)
- the PILAINC environment variable works under Linux as well
- Pila compiles with fewer warnings under Linux

Beta 3 Fluff 6 (12 Feb 1998)
More Linux fixes by Michael Dreher (michael@odo.boeblingen.netsurf.de)
- gcc -Wall produces no warnings whatsoever now
- should, perhaps, with some luck, work well even under big-endian machines

Beta 3 Fluff 7 (18 Mar 1998)
Misc fixes by Mikael Klasson (fluff@geocities.com) and Michael Dreher
(michael@odo.boeblingen.netsurf.de)
- defining an address operand like (a6,6) instead of 6(a6) caused the 
  assembler to crash
- spaces in expressions didn't work very well
- compiles without warnings using glibc
- eliminated a few potential sources of bugs

Pila Version 2.0 (23 Jul 2003)
Major overhaul of Pila by Frank Schaeckermann (frmipg602@sneakemail.com)
Please read the pila-user-manual.html since sooooo many things changed...

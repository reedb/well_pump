Collins Farm Well, private repository, complete

The well is 105' deep and the majority of the water comes in at 85'. 
The static water level in the well is at 15'. 

The Well Bore Water Level Sensor is just above the well pump at 80 feet.
When it reads close to zero, the pump should not be run (out of water).
